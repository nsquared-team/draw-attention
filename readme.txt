== Description ==
[Draw Attention®](https://wpdrawattention.com?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=draw-attention) makes it easy to create [interactive image maps](https://wpdrawattention.com/guides/first-interactive-image/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=interactive-image-maps) for your website. [Highlight sections](https://wpdrawattention.com/guides/drawing-tool/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=highlight-sections) of your images with hotspots so that users can click/tap or hover to read more information about each image map area. [Show more content](https://wpdrawattention.com/demos/cheese-plate/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=show-more-content) or [direct the user to another URL](https://wpdrawattention.com/demos/apartment-building/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=go-to-url) upon clicking or hovering your hotspot.

The image map can contain more information such as images, text, shortcodes, gallery, video, audio, and more. Reveal more information on click/tap or hover.  Create custom shapes for interactive hotspots directly on your original image.

### Responsive Design ###
Interactive image maps resize to fit your theme and the available screen size. Draw Attention works on all devices and adjusts your image to screens of any size. Works great on touch screens, such as tablet and mobile, too!

### Accessible ###
[Image maps are accessible](https://wpdrawattention.com/guides/interactive-image-faq/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=accessibility#do-draw-attention-interactive-images-support-accessibility-standards) to everyone who visits your site, regardless of device or capabilities. Your content is accessible to screen readers. All highlightable hotspots can be accessed by keyboard commands. Anyone on any device can use your interactive image map.

### SEO Friendly Clickable Annotations ###
Draw Attention is built with the principles of progressive enhancement in mind, so your content is accessible even to users who have JavaScript disabled and is SEO friendly, too! Draw Attention draws SVG shapes in modern browsers and falls back to a standard image map if JavaScript is disabled.

### Easy to Draw Image Maps ###
Easy to draw the highlightable areas of your image map - and easy to edit the shapes later too! Create the image map right from your WordPress dashboard. [Place your interactive image map into any page or post](https://wpdrawattention.com/guides/display-interactive-image/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=display-interactive-images) with a simple shortcode, or use our convenient Beaver Builder module or WordPress Editor Block.

### New and Improved Drawing Tool ###
Draw complex shapes or perfect circles and rectangles. Use the new zoom and pan feature to get extra precise drawings of your clickable hotspots. Easily edit the shapes whenever you'd like or start from scratch at the click of a button. 

The available [drawing tools](https://wpdrawattention.com/guides/drawing-tool/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=promo-link&utm_campaign=wordpress-org&utm_content=drawing-tools) are:

- **Polygon**: Create a custom polygon shape of your preference
